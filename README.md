# Eléazar Klyuvitkin's Portfolio

This project is a personal portfolio that I make available to inspire and help other developers. You are free to duplicate this portfolio for your own projects, but I kindly ask you to include the mention **"Inspired by Eléazar"**. This helps respect the ethics of sharing and mutual inspiration.
